# Agent Description — Triggering Reference

How to write a Claude Code agent `description:` field so that auto-dispatch fires reliably, when it fires vs when the user must invoke explicitly, and how to write `<example>` blocks for subtle cases.

## What the description field does

The `description:` field in an agent's frontmatter is the agent's **dispatch trigger**. When the parent model selects an agent to invoke via the Agent tool, it matches the user's intent against each available agent's description. A well-written description ensures the right agent fires on the right request — and not on unrelated ones.

The description is also visible to users in `/agent list` and in IDE agent pickers. It must be both machine-matchable (for auto-dispatch) and human-readable (for user selection).

## Rules for trigger-spec descriptions

### 1. Third-person, trigger-spec style

Write as if describing when a third party should use this agent. Never use first-person.

```yaml
# Wrong — first-person breaks matching
description: I audit links in a project and return a list of broken URLs.

# Correct — trigger-spec, third-person
description: Use when asked to audit links in a project. Triggers on "check links", "find broken URLs", "link audit", or any request to verify that URLs in source files resolve.
```

### 2. Lead with `Use when` or `Triggers on`

The opening clause tells the dispatch model the primary activation condition. Follow with a `Triggers on` list of literal trigger phrases the user might type.

```yaml
description: Use when generating a mock HTTP server from a spec or HAR file. Triggers on "generate mock server", "stub this API", "create a mock for", "mock server from HAR", or any request to produce a runnable stub service.
```

### 3. Trigger phrases should be quoted literals

Quote the exact phrases a user is likely to type. This is not documentation — it is a matching surface. Unquoted phrases blend into the prose and are harder for the dispatch model to weight.

### 4. Stay under 1024 characters

The description field has a hard limit of 1024 characters. Beyond that the runtime truncates it, which can break triggering. Check with:

```bash
echo -n "your description here" | wc -c
```

### 5. Leak-safe phrasing

Do not name internal implementation details, secret file paths, API keys, or internal capability flags in the description. The description is surfaced in the IDE and `/agent list` — treat it as public.

## When auto-dispatch fires vs when the user must invoke explicitly

### Auto-dispatch fires when:

- The parent model is deciding which sub-agent to delegate to.
- The user's message matches the trigger phrases or semantic intent in the description.
- The parent has been given the Agent tool and the current context makes agent delegation appropriate.

### Auto-dispatch does NOT fire when:

- The user addresses the parent model directly and asks it to do the work inline.
- The trigger match is ambiguous between two agents with overlapping descriptions.
- The parent model is in a context where it has decided to handle the task itself.

### Explicit invocation

Users can bypass auto-dispatch and invoke an agent directly:

```
/agent run link-checker
```

or via a slash command wrapper that calls the agent internally.

When triggers are subtle or the agent name is not obvious from the task, add explicit invocation instructions in the agent body (not the description — the body is the system prompt the agent sees, not the dispatch signal).

## Writing `<example>` blocks

Add `<example>` blocks in the **agent body** (the system prompt section below the frontmatter) when:

- The trigger condition is non-obvious (the agent handles a specialized edge case).
- Multiple agents could plausibly match the same request and you need to disambiguate.
- The output format needs an example to be unambiguous.

### Format

```xml
<example>
User: "Can you check whether all the links in the docs/ directory are still live?"
Action: Read each Markdown file in docs/, extract href and src values, HEAD-request each URL, return a table of status codes.
</example>

<example>
User: "Link audit on the README"
Action: Read README.md, extract all URLs, return a two-column table: URL | status.
</example>
```

### What examples are NOT for

- Do not put examples in the `description:` field — they consume the 1024-char budget without improving machine matching.
- Do not fabricate examples that don't reflect the agent's actual behavior — they will mislead the dispatch model and users.

## Overlap and disambiguation

When two agents in the same plugin could plausibly match the same trigger:

1. Make each `description:` **exclusive** rather than **inclusive**: describe what this agent does that the other one does not.
2. Add a disambiguation note at the end of each description:

```yaml
# link-checker
description: Use when auditing URLs in source files for liveness. Triggers on "check links", "find broken URLs", "link audit". Does NOT generate or modify files — read-only audit only.

# link-fixer
description: Use when broken links have been identified and need to be replaced or removed. Triggers on "fix broken links", "update URLs", "replace dead link". Requires a prior link-checker run or an explicit list of broken URLs.
```

## Checklist before shipping a description

- [ ] Third-person, not first-person
- [ ] Starts with `Use when` or `Triggers on`
- [ ] Trigger phrases are quoted literals
- [ ] Under 1024 characters (`echo -n "..." | wc -c`)
- [ ] No internal implementation details leaked
- [ ] Disambiguated from any overlapping agent in the same plugin
- [ ] Tested by reading it aloud: does it describe when to use this agent, not what the agent does internally?
