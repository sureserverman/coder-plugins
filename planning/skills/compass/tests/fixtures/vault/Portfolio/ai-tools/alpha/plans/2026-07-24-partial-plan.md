# Project Plan: Partial states
Date: 2026-07-24

Fixture for the `[~]` partial state (BL-001). One task of each kind, so the
counts must read done=1 / partial=1 / total=3: a partial task is unfinished
work — it counts toward `total` but never toward `done`, and it is a legitimate
`next_task`. Under the old `!= " "` classification this plan read done=2 and
would have reported in-flight work as finished.
