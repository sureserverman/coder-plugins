name: architecting-projects
description: Use after a design is validated (or on a direct architecture request) to research real architecture options for a project and produce the authoritative architecture document the plan is built around. Triggers on "design the architecture", "architecture options", "how should this project be structured", "what structure should this codebase have", "compare architectures for", "pick a project layout", or when the brainstorming skill hands off a design with a non-trivial structural surface. Researches 2–4 stack-concrete candidates via parallel architecture-researcher agents (every claim cited), presents a comparison matrix for explicit user approval, then writes an ARCH-ID-sectioned architecture doc that planning-projects consumes.

# Architecting Projects

Turn a validated design into a **researched, user-approved architecture** before any
plan is written. The output of this skill is an **architecture document** whose
`ARCH-NN` sections the `planning-projects` plan cites and the build follows.

**Announce at start:** "Using the architecting-projects skill to research and validate the project architecture."

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT write the architecture document, invoke `planning-projects`, or scaffold
anything until the comparison matrix has been presented and the user has explicitly
approved one option. Research findings are not a decision — the user's approval is.
</HARD-GATE>

## Position in the pipeline

`brainstorming` (validated design) → **architecting-projects** → `planning-projects`
(staged plan citing ARCH-IDs) → `executing-plans` (builds exactly that structure).

Also directly invocable without a prior design doc — then Phase 1 grounds from the
user's brief and the codebase instead.

**Skip rule (for callers):** skip this skill only when the design has no meaningful
structural surface — a config change, a single-file fix, a doc update. Skipping is
always stated explicitly ("no structural surface: straight to planning-projects"),
never silent.

## Checklist

Create a task for each of these and work them in order.

1. **Ground** — design doc, codebase, vault, backlog
2. **Derive candidates** — 2–4 stack-concrete architecture options
3. **Research in parallel** — one `architecture-researcher` agent per candidate
4. **Compare and recommend** — matrix + named recommendation; user approval gate
5. **Write the architecture document** — parser-safe, ARCH-NN sections
6. **Hand off to planning-projects**

---

## Phase 1 — Ground

Before deriving any candidate:

- Read the **design doc** from `brainstorming` (usually
  `<portfolio_home>/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`) — its constraints and
  success criteria bound every candidate. Directly-invoked with no design doc: distill
  the same facts (problem, constraints, stack, scale) from the user's brief and
  confirm them in one message before proceeding.
- Read the **codebase** if one exists: manifests, current layout, established
  dependencies, test framework. An existing project constrains candidates hard —
  re-architecture candidates must state their migration surface.
- Check the **vault** (`.claude/vault-context.md` sidecar) for prior architecture
  decisions and gotchas on this stack.
- Scan the **backlog** for open structural items the architecture should resolve or
  respect; note matches for the eventual plan's fold-in.

## Phase 2 — Derive candidates

Produce **2–4 candidates**. Each candidate is a named pattern **plus** a one-line
module-layout sketch concrete to this language/framework — "hexagonal: `core/` domain
crates, `adapters/` per port, binary in `cli/`" — never a pattern name alone.
Generic candidates ("monolith vs microservices") with no stack-level shape are the
failure mode this skill exists to prevent.

Fewer than 2 defensible candidates? Then the architecture is genuinely forced —
say so, present the single option with its evidence as a degenerate matrix, and still
get explicit approval before writing the doc.

## Phase 3 — Research in parallel

Dispatch **one `architecture-researcher` agent per candidate, concurrently**. Each
dispatch carries: the candidate (name + layout sketch), the stack (with pinned
versions where known), the constraints from Phase 1, and the codebase path or an
explicit greenfield flag.

On return, **discard uncited claims** — a finding with no doc URL, named real project,
or codebase file behind it does not enter the matrix. Then:

- An agent that fails or returns only uncited prose: drop that candidate and flag the
  gap in the matrix ("Candidate C: research failed — excluded").
- **Fewer than 2 evidenced candidates survive: stop.** Tell the user rather than fake
  a comparison; a single-survivor matrix is presented as the forced-choice case from
  Phase 2, with the failure noted.
- No web access this session: proceed on codebase/vault evidence, and carry the
  agents' `[web-unverified]` markers into the matrix and the final doc.

## Phase 4 — Compare, recommend, approve

Present a **comparison matrix** — one row per surviving candidate, columns: fit
against each named constraint, complexity, evolution paths, migration surface (for
existing code), evidence quality. Below it, a **named recommendation with a specific
reason**, exactly like `brainstorming` Phase 3.

Then the **approval gate** (the HARD-GATE above):

- User approves an option → Phase 5.
- User rejects all options → loop back to Phase 2 with the rejection reasons as new
  constraints. **Maximum 2 loops**, then escalate: present what was tried and ask for
  a direction rather than generating a third round unprompted.

## Phase 5 — Write the architecture document

Resolve the output location exactly as `planning-projects` does (read `vault_dir`
from `~/.claude/portfolio-config.yaml`; no `vault_dir` → fall back to
`<repo>/docs/plans/` and warn). Save as:

```
<portfolio_home>/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-architecture.md
```

### Parser-safety rules (MUST)

The doc lands in the same `plans/` directory that `portfolio-unify` scans, so it is
parser-safe **by construction**:

- The filename MUST NOT match `*-plan.md` (the `-architecture.md` suffix is the rule).
- The doc MUST NOT contain raw unchecked bullets (`- [ ]`) anywhere — lists use plain
  `-` bullets.
- The doc MUST NOT contain `- **Status:**` fields.

An architecture doc that emits portfolio-unify backlog candidates is malformed; the
fixture suite (`portfolio/tests/fixtures/plan-parser/sample-architecture.md`) locks
this invariant in CI.

### Document format

```markdown
# Architecture: <Topic>
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Design: ./<design-doc-filename>          (when one exists)
Status: Approved <YYYY-MM-DD>

## Decision
<chosen option, one paragraph, ADR-style: context → decision → consequences>

## Alternatives rejected
- <candidate>: <why not, from the matrix — cited>

## ARCH-01 Directory layout
<fenced tree, concrete names — the tree the plan's scaffold tasks create>

## ARCH-02 Module boundaries
<per-module responsibility and allowed dependencies>

## ARCH-03 Key interfaces
<the boundary signatures, per the winning candidate's research>

## ARCH-04 Data flow
<main-use-case sequence through the modules>

## ARCH-05 Library choices
<lib + version + role, citations carried from research>

## Risks
- <risk>: <mitigation or explicit acceptance>

## Evidence
- <the citations backing the decision, carried from the researcher returns>
```

Number further sections `ARCH-06` onward as needed; never renumber existing IDs in a
later revision — plans cite them.

## Phase 6 — Hand off to planning-projects

Say to the user:

> Architecture approved and saved to `<path>`. Handing off to the `planning-projects`
> skill — the plan's structure-creating tasks will cite these ARCH-IDs, and its final
> stage gate will carry the architecture-conformance check.

Then invoke `planning-projects` with both the design doc and the architecture doc as
input. The **only** skill invoked after this one is `planning-projects` — scaffolding
the tree directly is `executing-plans`' job, gated by the plan.

## Key principles

- **Research is per-candidate and parallel** — one pinned researcher each, blind to
  the other candidates.
- **Uncited claims are discarded** — the matrix holds evidence, not vibes.
- **The user chooses** — the skill recommends, the approval gate decides.
- **Parser-safe by construction** — no unchecked bullets, no Status fields, no
  `*-plan.md` filename.
- **ARCH-IDs are stable** — downstream plans cite them; revisions append, never
  renumber.
- **Terminal state is `planning-projects`** — never scaffold, never execute.
