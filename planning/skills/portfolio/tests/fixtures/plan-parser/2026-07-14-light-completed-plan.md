**Context:** Fixture for a fully-executed Light plan — every task `[x]` and a close-out
line present. Must yield zero backlog candidates, identical to a completed Standard plan.

## Stage 1: Light lane

### Task 1.1: Author the reference doc
- **Status:** [x]
- **Test:** `grep -q 'Light Plan' light-plan-format.md`

### Task 1.2: Add the parser fixture
- **Status:** [x]
- **Depends on:** Task 1.1
- **Test:** `python3 test-portfolio-unify.py`

### Stage 1 Gate
- [ ] LIGHT-DONE-GATE: integration check, excluded by the parser
- [ ] Full existing test suite passes

**Completed:** 2026-07-14 — commits: abc1234, def5678
