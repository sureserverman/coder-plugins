"""Fixture tests for plan-status-audit.py — the vault-wide plan-status audit.

Runs against a SYNTHETIC vault built per test, never the real one, so the
assertions are about the classifier rather than about whatever the live corpus
happened to say that morning. The live corpus is checked separately by
`--check`, whose acceptance is a set of INVARIANTS rather than frozen counts
(see check_invariants() for why the counts had to go).

Covers every class plus the adversarial cases Task 4.5 names: a plan whose only
task is `[~]`, a master whose register is complete but whose sub-plan is not, a
plan already carrying both terminal markers, a read-only plan file, and a plan
that disappears between enumeration and write.

No pytest dependency — plain assertions, non-zero exit on any failure.
Run locally:  python3 planning/skills/portfolio/tests/test-plan-status-audit.py
