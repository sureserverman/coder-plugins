"""review-ledger-check.py — a review a gate report claims was dispatched, was dispatched.

    review-ledger-check.py --plan P --stage N --repo R [--report F]
    review-ledger-check.py --unstopped --repo R

WHY THIS EXISTS. The gate report's review line (stage-gate.md § The gate report's
review line) names the agent that ran each review. Until 0.56.0 that line was a
self-report: a review the executor ran itself, or never ran, read exactly like one a
fresh agent ran (DEC-019's ledger). hooks/dispatch-log.sh now appends every Agent
dispatch, subagent start and stop of a plan run to <R>/.claude/dispatch-log.jsonl;
this script compares the two. The hook gathers, this script decides (DEC-027).

GATE MODE (--plan --stage). Reads Stage N's `review:` and `evaluator:` lines — from
--report F (a draft gate report; `-` is stdin) when given, else from the plan's
`## Stage N` section, where the handoff note carries them verbatim. Each line is one of:

  a dispatch claim   review: <label> <subagent_type> over <range> — <verdict>
                     evaluator: <subagent_type> in the <role> role … — <verdict>
  a substitution     SUBSTITUTED in the line's head — needs no dispatch (DEC-019:
                     a disclosed deviation, valid whatever the log says)
  a scope statement  a line naming no agent that says why no review ran — `not run`,
                     `not dispatched`, `not mandated`, an `opt-out`, a `trivial`
                     (`non-code`, `docs-only`, `config-only`, `comment-only`,
                     `version bump`) diff — in its head, or after a head saying it was
                     `skipped` ("review: Tier-2 not run — tier none", "review: Tier-2
                     skipped — docs-only diff"); a line stating a verdict (APPROVE, LGTM,
                     clean, `0 Critical`, PASS …) is never one
  a redesign line    review: round K: redesign — reviewed by <subagent_type> (a claim),
                     — battery <name> or — unread (scope, unless it states a verdict),
                     per gate-failure-procedure.md; read in any case, `round K` optional

The agent and SUBSTITUTED are read from the line's head — the text before the first
` — ` — so nothing written after the verdict can supply either. Prefixes are read in
any case and under list markers or bold. Any other line is ADVISORY (exit 4): "looked at
the diff, clean" may claim a review whatever words it uses, so the gate report names it.
It is advisory, not a failure (DEC-032): measured 2026-10-06 over 258 review:/evaluator:
lines in `Stage N green` commit bodies of 13 ~/dev repos, with this classifier (the
head-anchored reasons and the verdict exclusion included): 134 hits, 0 true — every hit
read was an honest review or scope line in a wording older than this grammar. DEC-031
fails only an unmatched dispatch claim. Text may follow the range ("over a..b
(round 2): APPROVE"). The task field `Review: required` / `Review: skip` is not a ledger
line. A stage with no ledger line at all is NOT CHECKED (exit 3): a gate report
states every review, run or not.

Each claim needs its own `dispatch` line of that subagent_type whose description names
`Stage N` and the claim's role (the word review or pass, or evaluator) and names no `Task N.M`,
logged at or after the newest `Stage N-1 green` commit (for Stage 1, the log's start).
So the executor writes the dispatch description as `Stage N Tier-2 review` or
`Stage N gate evaluator`. Two claimed passes need two dispatches.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO. It cannot tell whether the agent was briefed on the right diff,
or whether the verdict quoted is the one it returned — only that a dispatch of the
claimed type and role happened in the stage's window. The window rests on the newest
commit with the exact subject `Stage N-1 green`: a missing or reworded commit from this
plan lets an older plan's commit open it, and a log left behind by a plan whose
close-out never ran satisfies Stage 1 claims.

UNSTOPPED MODE (--unstopped). Lists every agent with a `start` line and no `stop`
line — an agent still running after the run that started it used its result.

EXIT CODES:
  0  every claim matched / no agent left running
  1  a claimed dispatch has no match, or an agent is still running (each named)
  2  usage error (no Stage N section, no `Stage N-1 green` commit, unreadable input,
     no git)
  3  NOT RUN — the dispatch log is missing — or NOT CHECKED — no review: or
     evaluator: line for the stage; never 0
  4  gate mode only: every claim matched, and a line names no agent and gives no
     reason (ADVISORY, each named); --unstopped uses only 0, 1 and 3
