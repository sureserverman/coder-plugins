# statusline-chain — wraps a base statusline with the executing-plans plan
# progress bar.
#
# Why: users already have a statusline command configured; this shim leaves
# it untouched and appends the plan-progress bar (present only while a plan is
# executing) on the NEXT line — not "line 2", since a base statusline may
# itself emit several lines (Claude Code's own bundled one embeds a newline in
# its "Update available" notice). Both consumers read the SAME stdin bytes
# (Claude Code's statusline JSON), captured once here so neither one starves
# the other.
#
# Accepted limitation: command substitution strips trailing newlines, so a base
# that deliberately ends in a blank line for spacing loses it. Preserving it
# would need a sentinel-and-strip dance; the spacing is not worth that.

# A statusline is redrawn constantly, so a subprocess that blocks (a dead
# network mount, a stuck filesystem call, an infinite loop) would freeze the
# redraw indefinitely — worse than a missing line, and with nothing to explain
# it. Bound both subprocesses.
#
# The two bounds differ ON PURPOSE, and the base's is deliberately generous.
# A base statusline legitimately does slow work and bounds itself: the widely
# installed ClaudeCodeStatusLine makes `curl -s --max-time 10` and
# `--max-time 5` calls, so a snug wrapper bound would cut off a base that is
# working exactly as designed and silently truncate the user's own status line.
# This wrapper's job is to catch an UNBOUNDED hang, not to second-guess a base
# that already bounds itself — so the default sits above any such self-bound.
# plan-progress.py is ours and only reads local files, so it gets a tight one.
#
# `timeout` is GNU coreutils and absent from a stock macOS, a platform this repo
# supports; fall back to gtimeout, then to running unbounded rather than losing
# the statusline entirely. Unquoted on purpose: empty must expand to no words.
