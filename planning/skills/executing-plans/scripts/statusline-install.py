"""statusline-install — manage the ONE `statusLine` key in the user's global
~/.claude/settings.json, pointing it at the sibling statusline-chain.sh.

Why this script exists: a Claude Code plugin's settings.json only supports
`agent` and `subagentStatusLine` as contribution points — `statusLine` is not
one of them. So exactly one line in the user's *global* settings.json is
irreducible, and this script is what writes/repairs/removes that line so the
user never has to hand-edit JSON.

CLI:
    statusline-install.py               install/repair the pointer (default)
    statusline-install.py --install     same, explicit
    statusline-install.py --status      report what is currently wired
    statusline-install.py --remove      remove the statusLine key
    statusline-install.py --force       (with --install) overwrite a
                                         statusLine this script did not install

Settings path is ~/.claude/settings.json, resolved via Path.home() (which
honors the HOME environment variable) so tests can point it at a temp dir.
