    prove-claim.py replay    --repo R --plan P [--task N.M] [--timeout S]
    prove-claim.py fingerprint --repo R

WHY THIS EXISTS. Nine metabrush-android tasks executed by Cursor shipped one
defect over and over: a check that passed while measuring nothing (a /tmp check
that could not see TMPDIR, a TIFF with no metadata to remove, a photo Android
never redacts, an Error test that passed with the cleanup deleted), or a claim
of proof that was not one (a substituted easier break, a `mutation:` line that
was false). The agent that wrote the code also wrote the test and the sentence
saying the test works. A sentence cannot be audited; a run can. So a claim is
proven only by this tool having watched it:

  1. the worktree equals the index outside proof/, nothing untracked, no index
     flags hiding a change — the record binds to exactly what will be committed
  2. --test is a command written in the task's `Test:` field, never free text
     (a "test" of `git diff --quiet` goes red for any change at all)
  3. the build (when given) and the test PASS as the code stands
  4. the break — a content edit of existing, tracked, regular, non-test files
     only, read once into a private copy — is applied; a journal under .git
     records what it touched, so a killed run is undone by the next one
  5. the code still builds with the break (a break that stops compilation turns
     every test red); the test FAILS, and not because it could not run
  6. every touched file is restored and verified byte-identical, with an mtime
     newer than anything built under the break; the build runs again; the whole
     tree must then be exactly as before — otherwise exit 3
  7. a record is written to proof/<plan-stem>/<task>/claim-<K>.json

`req` records that a requirement clause was checked — by a command that passes,
and FAILS under a break of that requirement, through the same run as a claim
(a check that cannot fail, like `echo ok`, is refused) — or is covered by a
proven claim. `deviation` records one that could not be checked.
`replay` re-runs every claim record's break against the tree as it stands.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO. Whether a break, or a req check, is the one that matters
is judgment — the verifier's (agents/claim-verifier.md). The plan's "red if …"
is recorded as `named_break` so a reader can compare. A record written by hand
is still possible; replay, the fingerprint binding and validate() make it a
deliberate lie rather than an oversight. One run each: a flaky test can pass.

EXIT CODES: 0 proven / recorded / replay clean · 1 not proven or refused (no
record written) · 2 usage or IO error, or another run holds the lock · 3 the tree
is not as it was, or an interrupted run was just recovered (or its journal no
longer matches the repo) — check the tree by hand before anything else.
