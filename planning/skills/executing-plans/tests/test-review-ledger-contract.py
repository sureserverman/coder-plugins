"""Structure suite for the review-ledger close-out contract — run directly (CI convention):
    python3 planning/skills/executing-plans/tests/test-review-ledger-contract.py

These are PROSE contracts, not behavior. The suite asserts that the skill text
states the rules a master close-out must follow when it reconciles the review
ledger; it cannot and does not verify that a close-out obeys them. The ledger
itself lives in gate-report prose that no script reads (DEC-022), so what IS
mechanically checkable is that the rule is stated where it is consumed.

What it pins (BL-093 + the report-line half of BL-094, and BL-105 (b) in 4-6):
  1. master-plans.md step 5 reconciles the review ledger plan-wide — for each
     sub-plan, which tiers ran, over which diff, and a count against what the
     declared tier owed — in the literal `reviews: <n> of <owed>` form, and the
     paragraph sits BEFORE the `**Completed:**` line instruction. The incident:
     under `review-scope: high`, the gate evaluator ran for sub-plan 1 and never
     again, and every per-gate report was individually honest — the failure is
     one level up, which is why this is a close-out rule and not a validator.
  2. close-out.md step 9's "Reviews that ran" bullet points a master plan at that
     per-sub-plan reconciliation, in the same form.
  3. stage-gate.md § "The gate report's review line" says every evidence line
     names its substrate (host / emulator / container / target device) and CITES
     honest-gates § Reporting for what that changes rather than restating the
     BLOCKED rule — the one negative check here, since the requirement's subject
     is an absence.

  4. stage-gate.md § The dispatched-vs-inline review ledger runs review-ledger-check.py
     once per gate entry: the review line names the subagent type it dispatched, exit 1
     fails the gate (never softened to advisory), exit 3 is reported NOT RUN, never green.
  5. close-out.md and session-handoff.md § On `handoff` both run `--unstopped` before
     reporting — an agent still running is named, not left behind.
  6. close-out.md § Last step deletes `.claude/dispatch-log.jsonl` beside the state file,
     so a log never outlives its run and satisfies the next plan's claims.

Deliberately small — one assertion per rule. These catch DELETION of a rule,
which is the failure that actually happens; they do not pretend to catch every
rewording.
