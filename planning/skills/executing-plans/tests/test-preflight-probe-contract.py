"""Structure suite for the Preflight gate-selector probe (BL-063) — run directly:

    python3 planning/skills/executing-plans/tests/test-preflight-probe-contract.py

PROSE contract, not behavior, with the shared negation screening (DEC-008). The
authoring half (validate-gate-checks.py SELECTOR-UNMATCHED) reads pytest, Gradle and
cargo selectors; the runtime half — preflight-checks.md § Gate-selector probe — was
pytest-only, so a flagged Gradle or cargo selector had nowhere to be settled. It pins:

  1. cargo: a gate's `cargo test <filter>` is probed with `-- --list` and must list a test.
  2. Gradle: `--tests '<pattern>'` must match a test class or method name under the
     project's test source sets, by a source search (Gradle has no cheap listing).
  3. A zero result is a Preflight plan defect for every runner — never advisory.
  4. The pytest probe's command is unchanged.
