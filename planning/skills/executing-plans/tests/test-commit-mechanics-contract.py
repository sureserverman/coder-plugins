"""Structure suite for the commit-mechanics contract — run directly (CI convention):
    python3 planning/skills/executing-plans/tests/test-commit-mechanics-contract.py

A PROSE contract, not behavior. The suite asserts that the skill text states the
execution-discipline rules Stage 1 of the session-mined-flaws plan added — the
commit mechanics for a plan that lives outside the repo, the turn discipline that
keeps an announcement from standing in for the work, and the single form a report
uses to ask the user for something. It cannot verify that an executor obeys any of
them — stated plainly, because a structure suite that implies behavioral coverage
is the falsehood class `honest-gates` exists to catch. The file keeps its original
name so the plan's Task 1.1 `Test:` field still resolves.

What it pins (Task 1.1):
  1. The trunk NAMES the vault-resident-plan case — that a plan can live outside
     the repo it plans, which is the portfolio convention, not an edge case.
  2. It mandates editing the plan at an ABSOLUTE PATH and forbids `cd`-ing to the
     plan's directory to do it.
  3. It mandates running the commit FROM THE REPO ROOT.
  4. It names the observed failure (`fatal: not a git repository`), so the rule
     reads as a report of something that happened rather than as a style note.
  5. `references/task-execution.md` carries the elaboration, so the reference the
     trunk points at is not a dead end.

Why the rule needs to exist at all: rule 7 mandates committing "the flipped
`Status: [x]`" in the same commit as the work, which silently assumes the plan
file is inside the repo. With a vault-resident plan it is not, and the observed
executor behaviour was to chain a directory change into the plan's directory
before the git command — ~20-25 failed commits across four sessions.

What it pins (Task 1.2 — turn discipline):
  6. § Run to completion forbids ending a turn on a stage or task announcement,
     and requires the tool call that opens the next stage/task in the SAME turn
     as the sentence announcing it, or instead of it.
  7. It names the observed shape — a turn whose last words are "Starting Stage
     N." with no tool call — so the rule is evidenced rather than stylistic.

What it pins (Task 1.3 — the ACTION NEEDED callout):
  8. Both report-owning references — stage-gate.md and close-out.md — define an
     `ACTION NEEDED:` block with NUMBERED options.
  9. Both forbid a report that carries one from also announcing that it is
     proceeding.
 10. Both state that a report carries at most ONE such block.
     Checked as a SET across the two files, because a gate report and a close-out
     report are two instances of one defect class and a check naming only one of
     them cannot fail on the other.

     **Coverage limit, stated because overstating it is the defect this suite
     exists to catch.** The plan's `Test:` field calls for "a single isolated"
     form. What is checked is that each reference *states* the one-block rule —
     a prose contract has no report to count blocks in. A report that violates
     the rule at runtime is not something any assertion here can see.

What it pins (Task 1.4 — the honest-gates capsule, BL-083):
 11. The four load-bearing honest-gates rules, plus the BLOCKED antecedent, appear
     verbatim BOTH in honest-gates/SKILL.md and in the trunk's Step 3.5. Pinning
     both directions is the point: a one-way check would let the restatement rot
     the moment honest-gates was reworded.
 12. The capsule keeps RED as its own state, routed to the gate-failure procedure.
     Entry 11's fifth phrase and this assertion were both added after a Tier-1
     Critical: the first draft's connective glue ("Otherwise BLOCKED, never green")
     negated the conjunction "ran AND passed" and so swallowed RED — and because
     the glue was original prose rather than a quoted rule, nothing pinned it.
     That is the general lesson: the four quotes were faithful and the sentence
     joining them was not.

What it pins (Task 1.5 — the dispatched-vs-inline review ledger):
 13. Both the trunk's gate-report review line and stage-gate.md's ledger name an
     inline-run mandated review a SUBSTITUTION, require a recorded reason, and
     state that an unrecorded one FAILS THE GATE — a consequence, not a request.
 14. The trunk states DEC-014's bound in proximity to the citation, not as two
     unrelated mentions. A Tier-1 Critical here was the reverse error to 1.4's:
     the first draft let a DISPATCH FAILURE authorise the substitution, when
     integration.md § Review opt-out closes the excuses at two and says an
     undispatchable reviewer is neither — it is a Stop condition, and the choice
     is the user's. The rule had inverted the source it cited.

The five tasks share one suite because they share one failure mode: a rule the
executor reads and then does not apply at the moment of pressure. Rule text is
the only artifact any of them can be checked against.
