"""Fixture suite for prove-claim.py — run directly (repo convention):

WHAT THIS SUITE IS REALLY GUARDING. prove-claim.py exists because an executor
that writes its own proof sentences wrote false ones. Each negative fixture
below is one shape a fake proof took in the metabrush-android incident record,
and each says which guard it pins: a break the test never notices; a break of
the test instead of the code; a break that stops the build; a test that fails
anyway; a proof taken on a tree that is not the one being committed; a restore
that silently did not happen. If a fixture stops failing, that fake is back.
