"""Fixture suite for review-ledger-check.py — run directly (repo convention):

    python3 planning/skills/executing-plans/tests/test-review-ledger-check.py

WHAT THIS SUITE IS REALLY GUARDING. A gate report's review line was a self-report:
"review: Tier-2 git-github:code-reviewer over <base>..HEAD — APPROVE" read the same
whether a reviewer ran or not (DEC-019's ledger). review-ledger-check.py compares each
claimed dispatch with the dispatch log hooks/dispatch-log.sh writes. The failures that
matter: a fabricated review passing, an old dispatch (an earlier stage's) satisfying a
new claim, a missing log reading as green, a disclosed SUBSTITUTED line being refused,
and an agent left running going unreported. One case builds its log through the real
hook, so the script and the hook cannot drift apart on the line format.
