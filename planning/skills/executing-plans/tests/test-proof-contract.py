"""Structure suite for the proof-by-tool contract — run directly (CI convention):
    python3 planning/skills/executing-plans/tests/test-proof-contract.py

A PROSE contract, not behavior. It asserts that the skill text routes a task's
proof through `prove-claim.py` and positions the record audit at the stage gate.
It cannot verify that an executor obeys either — stated plainly, because a
structure suite that implies behavioral coverage is the falsehood class
`honest-gates` exists to catch. The tools' behavior is pinned by their own
suites (test-prove-claim.py, test-plan-flip-audit.py) and the battery.

Every prose requirement is pinned with the shared clause screening
(test-gate-remediation-contract.py's `affirms_claim`, DEC-008), so a sentence that
names the tool only to opt out of it ("you need not run prove-claim.py claim")
does not satisfy the check.

What it pins (Task 2.1 — executing-plans):
  1. Rule 4a records the proof with `prove-claim.py claim`, for the first claim and
     every claim marked `(red if …)`, and stages `git add proof/` with the commit.
  2. Rule 4a no longer asks for the hand-written mutation sentence.
  3. Rule 4a routes a requirement through `prove-claim.py req` or
     `prove-claim.py deviation`, and the device-only case to a deviation.
  4. Step 3.5 runs `plan-flip-audit.py … --repo` at every stage gate, and a
     blocking finding fails the gate.

What it pins (Task 2.2 — the two skills that must say the same):
  5. dispatching-parallel-agents' prompt template tells the dispatched task to
     run `prove-claim.py claim` and `git add proof/` before it commits — a
     dispatched task that may still hand-write its proof is the gap rule 4a closed
     for inline tasks only.
  6. honest-gates § *A test does not exist until its mutant dies* records the
     mutant's proof with `prove-claim.py`, and its device-only line is a
     deviation; neither skill still asks for the hand-written sentence.
