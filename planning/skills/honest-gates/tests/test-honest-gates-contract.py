"""Contract suite for honest-gates — run directly (CI convention):

    python3 planning/skills/honest-gates/tests/test-honest-gates-contract.py

These are PROSE contracts, not behavior. The suite asserts that the trunk STATES
each rule in a clause that carries no negation; it cannot verify that an executor
obeys one. Stated plainly because a structure suite that implies behavioral
coverage is the falsehood class honest-gates exists to name.

Two halves, and they answer different questions:

  1. **Sentence checks.** Each pinned rule is matched with `affirms_claim`, borrowed
     by path from executing-plans' gate-remediation suite so this file does not
     hand-roll a sixth negation screen (DEC-008: the screening span is derived from
     the text — back to the clause boundary, forward to the sentence end). A rule
     inverted in place ("you need not …") fails here, which is the half
     `check-trunk-retention.py` cannot see (its markers pin presence only — BL-075).

  2. **Mutation battery.** For every retention marker the classification table
     declares, delete that marker's line from a temp copy of the trunk and assert
     `check-trunk-retention.py --root <tmp>` reports MISSING-RULE naming it. The
     count is derived from the table, never typed, so a marker added later without
     a killing mutation is a red suite rather than a silent gap. This is
     honest-gates' own rule — each guard independently reachable from a named
     test — applied to the guard that protects honest-gates.

Every check also records the pattern it matched, and the suite fails if two checks
pinned the same sentence: one owner per fact.

    be screened is everything in the sentence EXCEPT the match: the run-up from the

    alternative is what stops a bold sentence's tail leaking into the next paragraph).
