# Honest Gates

A gate is a claim that something was verified. This skill exists because the
cheapest way to make a gate "pass" is to lie about it — stub the task, skip the
run, or hand-write the evidence. Never do that. A faked gate is worse than a
failing one: it hides the failure and poisons every decision downstream.

## The one rule

**A gate is green only when its real command ran in the current environment and
actually passed. Nothing else counts as green.**

If you cannot make the real check run here, the gate is **BLOCKED**, not green.
Stop and escalate (see below). Do not invent a substitute that passes.

**Violating the letter of a gate is violating its spirit.** A gate named
`validateDebugScreenshotTest` that does no screenshot validation satisfies the
letter ("a task by that name exits 0") while betraying the purpose. The purpose is
the gate. When you catch yourself optimizing for the green checkmark instead of the
thing it certifies, stop — that impulse is the failure mode this skill exists to
name. Diagnose blockers with evidence (`no-fafo-debugging`), never by guessing a
fix that happens to make the check pass.

## Prohibited (these are gate-faking)

- **No-op tasks that impersonate a gate.** Never register a build task whose name
  matches a required gate (e.g. `validateDebugScreenshotTest`,
  `connectedDebugAndroidTest`) but whose body only logs "skipped"/"placeholder"
  and exits 0. If the real tooling isn't wired, the gate is BLOCKED.
- **A gate artifact the executor authored.** A gate script written or modified during
  the run is named in the gate report, with what changed — the author of a check is part
  of what the check discloses (*No-op tasks* above governs a registered task by name;
  this governs the script the executor wrote). A script whose non-comment body cannot reach both
  outcomes is not a gate: `echo OK` after a comment is a stub pass, an unconditional
  `exit 2` is a stub block, and both closed the same sub-plan green in one fortnight
  (`references/incidents.md`).
- **Fabricated evidence.** Never hand-author benchmark output (gfxinfo, frame
  stats), device logs, screenshots, or playtest/session results. Evidence must be
  the captured output of a command that actually ran. If you didn't run it, you
  don't have the evidence.
- **Silently excluding the failing case.** Do not add runner exclusions
  (`notClass`, `-PexcludeTests`, `@Ignore`, skip flags) to make a suite green, then
  report the suite green. Disabling a check is a BLOCKED gate, not a pass — and so is
  an economy: a suite removed from a gate command for time, disk or cost is `[~]`
  BLOCKED on that suite. Cost, time and disk are never an authorizing rule for an
  amendment; they argue for re-scoping the plan, never the evidence a written gate
  demands. The tiering policy is untouched, and the line between the two is substantive,
  not a matter of disclosure: narrowing per `test-scope-tiers.md` drops only trees the
  stage's commits neither touched nor depend on; that is scope, reported on the gate's
  scope line, not an amendment. A suite a written check names, or a tree the
  stage did touch, removed for cost, is `[~]` whatever the report calls it
  (`references/incidents.md`).
- **"Written" ≠ "passing."** A test that exists but never executed proves nothing.
  Authoring `FooTest.kt` does not satisfy a gate that requires `FooTest` to pass.
- **Heuristic self-grading.** Do not stamp `Pass: true` on a measurement that
  misses its own threshold. Report the number and the verdict it actually earns.
- **Proxy data that doesn't measure what the gate measures.** Label proxy evidence
  as proxy and leave the real gate BLOCKED (example: `references/incidents.md`).
- **Unannotated amendment of a gate's own checks.** Rewriting what a check verifies,
  or how wide it sweeps, and then reporting the result as though the authored check
  passed. A legitimate amendment exists — the rules a plan was authored under do move
  — but it is annotated with the rule that authorized it and the value it replaced
  (`../executing-plans/SKILL.md` § *Amending authored ceremony*); why disclosure is the
  whole difference: `references/incidents.md`. **Amending a check to make a failing gate
  pass is never an amendment** — that is the gate-failure procedure wearing its clothes.
- **Verifying against a dirty working tree.** A gate whose commands ran over
  uncommitted edits proves nothing about what the branch records: the next reader,
  the next stage, and CI all see the committed state, not yours. Commit first, then
  run the gate — and if a gate was run early to save time, re-run it after the commit
  rather than reporting the earlier result
  (`/mnt/vault/Gotchas/Gate Verified Against Uncommitted Working Tree.md`).

## When a gate is BLOCKED

Blocked = the real check cannot run here (no device/emulator, missing SDK, needs
human testers, missing secret, network-restricted). Then:

1. **Stop on that gate.** Do not advance to the next task or stage.
2. **Name the exact blocker** and the exact command that cannot run.
3. **Try to unblock it for real** if it's in scope (stand up an emulator, install
   the SDK package, wire the missing plugin). Resolving the blocker is always
   preferred over escalating.
4. **If it can't be unblocked here, escalate to the user** with the blocker and
   what you'd need. Mark the gate BLOCKED in your status, never green.
5. **Write the checklist item as `- [~]`, never `- [x]` with a note explaining
   it away.** `[~]` is the gate checklist's BLOCKED state and it parses
   everywhere the plan tooling reads — a ticked box carrying
   *(amended — exit 2; no hardware)* is a GREEN check to every reader, and the
   prose that says otherwise is invisible to all of them. This is the exact
   shape BL-077 was filed from: a plan rendered **Completed:** with every
   hardware-in-the-loop box ticked and annotated. The annotation is still worth
   writing; it goes beside the `[~]`, not instead of it.

Preflight blockers (repo/SDK/device marked FAILED) are BLOCKED gates by
definition. Building "around" them and declaring later gates green is the exact
failure this skill prevents.

## A behavioral claim is a gate too

Those rules govern claims about *verification runs*. The same rule governs
claims about *what the code does* — because **a sentence asserting behavior is
itself a claim that something was verified**, and it is read by people who will
act on it without re-checking.

So when you write, into a doc, README, skill, comment, commit message or report,
an assertion about behavior — what a flag defaults to, what a command exits with,
what invokes what, what is auto-detected, what a script covers — **cite the
`file:line` you checked it against.** In a commit message or an adjacent comment
is fine; the citation does not have to survive into user-facing prose, it has to
have existed when the sentence was written. If you did not open the file, you do
not have the claim. "It's obviously true" and "it was true last time" are the two
ways this goes wrong.

**When there is no single line to cite**, the requirement does not lapse — it
changes shape:

- **An absence claim** ("nothing wires this", "no caller reaches X", "no validator
  checks Y") is proved by a *search*, not a line. Cite the query and the scope it
  ran over (`grep -rn 'foo' planning/skills/` → no matches). An empty result over
  the wrong tree is not evidence.
- **An emergent or aggregate claim** ("the suite is hermetic", "every plugin
  ships a README") is a claim about a set — write it as the sweep that proves it,
  per the class-predicate rule (`planning-projects`), and cite the sweep. If you
  cannot express it as a sweep, weaken the sentence until it matches what you
  actually checked.

Two rules with teeth, both drawn from observed failures rather than principle:

- **A correction is a new claim.** Discovering that a sentence was wrong tells you
  the old text was wrong; it does not tell you the replacement is right. Verify the
  replacement against the source, exactly as if no sentence had been there. It has
  happened here (`178f988` → `edaeba2`; `references/incidents.md`).
- **Unrequested specificity is where errors hide.** A model pin nobody asked for, a
  count ("all 14 plugins"), an "every"/"never", a version number, a precise path —
  these read as authority and are rarely checked. Verify it or omit it. Vaguer and
  true beats specific and wrong; if the specific number matters, go get it.

**This one cannot be a script.** No validator can decide whether an English
sentence asserts behavior, so there is no `check-behavioral-claims.py` and this
section is deliberately a write-time discipline plus a thing reviewers look for
(`executing-plans`, both review tiers). Saying so is itself the rule: claiming a
guard exists here would be the very falsehood the section forbids.

## A test does not exist until its mutant dies

The rules above govern claims about runs and about code. This one governs the
**check itself**, because a green suite is the claim everything else is built on,
and a test derived from the fix it is meant to guard cannot fail on it.

**First, before any of it: can this mechanism decide this property?** Name what the
check actually decides. If that is a fact about the *meaning* of prose — does this
sentence instruct, assert, disclose, promise — **no pattern can decide it**; this file's
§ *A behavioral claim is a gate too* says so already; hardening buys one evasion class per
round (`references/incidents.md`).

Two ways out, and they are the only two. **Make the property structural** — a delimited
block, a required literal, a machine-readable marker — so the question becomes decidable
and text outside the structure cannot satisfy it. Or **leave it to review and say so in
the checker**, which is what `check-behavioral-claims.py` not existing means.

Written from a checker that cost five Criticals to learn this; the position — first — is
the fix (`references/incidents.md`). The test-first rule in `executing-plans` Step 3.3 is
correct and unenforceable after the fact; what follows is the part that leaves evidence.

Three rules, in the order they have to happen. They cost a command each and no
agent dispatch, so they are **untiered — they run at every review scope including
`none`** (DEC-010's cost line as DEC-017 corrected it for commands: a mandate costing a line of text or a local
re-run is not tiered; a mandate costing an agent is).

1. **Write the set down before the fix.** Before patching, enumerate the
   population the defect belongs to — as a *command*, in the commit: `grep -rl`,
   a list of siblings, every caller of the changed symbol. Fix every member, then
   derive one test from the set — a fix scoped from the one counterexample regenerates
   on the next sibling.

2. **Revert the fix; the suite must go red.** If it stays green you do not have a
   weak test, you have **no test** — and you cannot know which, because both look
   identical from a passing run. Name the mutation and the count in the commit
   ("reverting the `active` expression turns 3 checks red"). This is the whole
   rule: a check that cannot fail is not evidence, and it is indistinguishable
   from one that can until you try. One red proves one guard, so **each guard is
   independently reachable from a named test** — two guards that each keep the other's
   fixture clean stay green with either deleted, and that is no test for either. For a
   check whose output is a *verdict* rather than a value, the proof is a **mutation
   battery, one mutation per guard**; a survivor is a guard with no test, and a masking
   pair is its common shape (`references/incidents.md`).

3. **Build fixtures from the requirement, never from observed behavior.** The
   moment a fixture is shaped by what the code currently does, it can no longer
   falsify what the code currently does (a 41-test suite green over its own defect:
   `references/incidents.md`).

**Assert the discriminating cause, not the outcome.** `refused` is satisfied by
an argparse error, an ImportError, and the guard under test; `refused with the
guard's own wording` is satisfied by one of them. Whenever an assertion can be
made true by something other than the mechanism you are testing, it will
eventually be made true that way, and the suite will report it as a pass.

Unlike the two sections before it, this one catches a *true* sentence —
"the suite passes" — that means less than the reader takes it to mean
(`references/incidents.md`).

## Changing a contract reclassifies everything already written

This rule governs a change whose effect lands elsewhere — in documents already written,
under rules their authors could not have followed.

**A change to a parsing contract, marker vocabulary or classification rule does not ship
until the corpus it reclassifies has been inventoried, and each member either backfilled
or filed as a named migration entry.** Shipping the rule and leaving the corpus is not a
partial fix — it is a new classification asserted over documents nobody opened.

**The inventory is a command and its output, never an estimate.** An uncounted set cannot
be backfilled, checked off, or declared done.

Worked example: `4bb486e` flipped 19 closed plans across 9 projects to `blocked`
(`references/incidents.md`).

**Tier: untiered.** One enumeration command and at most one backlog entry, never a
dispatch, so per DEC-010's cost line as DEC-017 extends it to commands, it runs at every
review scope including `none`. Named because DEC-017 requires a mandate to state the rule
that gates it.

**Adds, net.** It removes nothing, costs one sweep per contract change, and catches the
change that is right in the diff and wrong in the corpus (`references/incidents.md`).

## Reporting

When you report status, every gate is one of: **GREEN** (real command + passed,
quote it), **RED** (ran, failed), or **BLOCKED** (couldn't run, with the reason).
Never collapse BLOCKED into GREEN. If asked "is this done?", a stage with any
BLOCKED gate is not done.

A GREEN also names where its evidence executed — host, emulator, container, or target
device — and a claim about *deployed* behaviour whose evidence ran anywhere else is
**BLOCKED**, not green — the *Proxy data* prohibition with the substrate as its subject
(`references/incidents.md`). Every number is reproducible:
a figure is emitted by a command at a sha it names, or carries the sha it was taken at,
and a corpus figure states its selection rule — a count nobody can re-take is not a
measurement.

## Integration

- `executing-plans` — enforces these rules at every stage gate.
- `gate-audit` — detects after the fact where these rules were broken.
- `android-gradle-build` / `android-stage-verify` — supply the *real* build/test/
  device commands so a gate never has to be faked for lack of technique.
- `no-fafo-debugging` — evidence-first diagnosis instead of guessing a passing fix.
