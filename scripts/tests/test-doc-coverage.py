"""Fixture tests for scripts/check-doc-coverage.py.

The guard was shipped proven only by a smoke-run against the live repo, which
demonstrates "today's tree happens to pass" and nothing about boundary conditions.
These pin the parsing logic against contrived trees:

  * a missing README fails, and reports every component as undocumented;
  * a component named in the README passes; one absent fails, BY NAME;
  * word-boundary matching — `backlog` is NOT satisfied by `global-backlog`,
    and a hyphenated name is not satisfied by half of itself;
  * an allowlist entry exempts exactly one component and nothing else;
  * the stub floor fires on a README that names everything and explains nothing;
  * /tests/ and /fixtures/ paths are excluded from the component set, so a
    plugin's own test data never becomes a documentation obligation.

No pytest. Plain assertions, non-zero exit on failure.
