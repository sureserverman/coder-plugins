"""Fixture tests for scripts/_contract_block.py.

This helper exists because three copies of "find the text between two markers" had already
diverged: one grew a duplicate-marker guard after a review found that only the first pair
was ever read, and the other did not — so the same malformed file was a finding in one
validator and invisible in the other. The cases below are the ones that divergence turned
into defects, pinned once so both consumers inherit the same answer.

Stdlib only.
