"""Discovery contract for scripts/run-tests.sh.

BL-020 was not "the bash suite is missing from the runner" — it was "the runner's
notion of what a suite is cannot grow". A runner that happens to find today's
suites proves nothing about the next one, in a new home or a new language, which is
exactly how the original gap appeared: the Preflight glob enumerated two
directories and one extension, so a bash suite added to a third directory was
invisible and silently skipped.

So these pin discovery itself, not a suite count:

  * every test-*.py / test-*.sh on disk appears in `run-tests.sh --list`, walked
    independently of the runner rather than by re-using its own glob;
  * a suite planted in a directory the runner has never seen is still discovered
    (the generality claim — this is the assertion that would have caught BL-020);
  * a planted .sh in a .py-only tree is discovered (the cross-language claim);
  * the comparison has teeth: a listing with one path withheld is reported as a
    discrepancy, so a passing run means agreement and not a vacuous match;
  * --list is side-effect free (it must not execute the suites it names);
  * an unknown argument is rejected rather than silently treated as a full run.

Every group that plants a file does so in a throwaway tree, never in the repo under
test — see throwaway_repo() for why cleanup blocks are not sufficient. Group 1 is the
only group that reads the real tree, and it writes nothing.

No pytest. Plain assertions, non-zero exit on failure.

    No group that writes a file writes it into the repo under test. Two reasons, both
    found the hard way. Invoking the full runner from inside a suite the runner
    discovers is unbounded recursion (this file -> run-tests.sh -> this file -> ...) —
    group 6's first cut hung until it was killed. And a hard kill mid-test leaves
    planted files behind in the real working tree, which happened during this suite's
    own development: a `finally:` block cleans up after an assertion failure but never
    after a SIGKILL, so isolation has to come from the tree, not from cleanup.

    This does not weaken the planting claims. Discovery is location-independent by
    construction — run-tests.sh derives REPO from its own path (line 29) and matches by
    filename — so a claim proved in a copied tree holds in the real one. Group 1 is
    what pins discovery against the real repo's size and prune rules; the planting
    groups pin its generality, which is orthogonal.
