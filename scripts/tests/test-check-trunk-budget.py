"""Fixture tests for scripts/check-trunk-budget.py.

The budget file is a RATCHET: every trunk carries a ceiling it may not exceed,
seeded at the size measured when the entry was written. The regression mode it
exists to stop is silent re-growth — executing-plans/SKILL.md gained 34% in the
six days between this plan being authored and executed.

The load-bearing cases are the ones proving the ratchet actually rejects: a
budget file that never fires is the stub Stage 1 exists to prevent. Stdlib only.
