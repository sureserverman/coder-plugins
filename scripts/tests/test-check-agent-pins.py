"""Fixture tests for scripts/check-agent-pins.py.

The load-bearing cases are the ones proving the sweep REJECTS. A pin check that
only ever passes certifies that every agent carries a deliberate cost pin while
the thirteenth quietly inherits the session's — which is the decay this validator
was added to stop.

The other case worth pinning is that HIGH-PIN and BAD-VALUE stay distinguishable.
The gate command this replaces was `^effort: *\\(low\\|medium\\|high\\)$`, a regex
that cannot express the valid `xhigh`, so a correct pin failed as though it were
malformed. A policy finding must be arguable; a syntax finding must not be.

Stdlib only.
