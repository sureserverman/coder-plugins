"""Extract a delimited contract block, once, for every validator that needs one.

Three copies of "find the text between two HTML comments" existed across
`check-agent-references.py` and `check-readonly-contract.py`, and they had already
diverged: one grew a duplicate-marker guard after a review found that only the first
pair was ever read, the other did not, so a second block appended to a file was
silently unchecked in one validator and not the other. `_frontmatter_common.py` states
the convention this file follows — the rules that must agree are imported from one
place so that they do agree.

The leading underscore keeps it out of `run-tests.sh`'s `check-*.py` validator glob.
