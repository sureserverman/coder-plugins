"""Heading extraction for a skill trunk, with fenced code blocks excluded.

Shared by check-extraction-classification.py and check-trunk-retention.py.

A `^#{2,4} ` regex over a SKILL.md does not read markdown, it reads lines — so a
heading inside a ```fence``` counts as a section of the trunk. That is not a
pedantic distinction here. When this module was written, `planning-projects/SKILL.md`
showed an author what a plan's `## Decisions in force` section should look like by
printing one inside a ```markdown fence, and a fence-blind scan reported it as the
trunk's own 38th heading.

**That example has since moved** — Task 3.1 relocated it to
`planning/skills/planning-projects/references/research-scans.md` one commit later —
so as of now the filter changes nothing on any of the three shipped trunks. The
module stays because the shape recurs whenever a skill documents a document
format, which these skills do constantly, and because the failure it prevents is
silent. **Its live coverage is the unit tests in
`scripts/tests/test-check-extraction-classification.py`, not the trunks** — do not
read a green tree as evidence this code is exercised.

Both guards then go wrong, and neither is recoverable by allowlisting:

  * check-extraction-classification.py demands a classification row for it, so
    the table has to file a decision about a code sample. Worse, the row is a
    time bomb: the day someone edits the example, the row "names no such
    heading" and the guard fails on a change that touched nothing real.
  * check-trunk-retention.py reads its binding sections from that same table, so
    it would sweep a section that does not exist and report the count as
    coverage.

The classification is the authority for what may leave a trunk, so it has to
quantify over the trunk's real sections and nothing else.

Why the two callers share this rather than each keeping a copy: they deliberately
keep their own PAIRS lists, because those are policy and may legitimately differ.
Parsing is not policy. Two guards disagreeing about what counts as a heading in
the same file is a silent divergence, and the one that sees fewer headings is the
one that stops guarding.

**Fences are stripped for HEADINGS, never for rule text.** An earlier cut of this
module also stripped fences before the retention check's substring match,
reasoning that a marker should be satisfied by prose rather than by a code sample.
Measured against the live table, that broke a legitimate marker: `Step 3.3` pins
`Executor: dispatched — <subagent_type>`, and the trailer shapes are a fenced
block because the rule *is* the literal. A rule may be a code block; only a
heading may not be.

Fence tracking is deliberately simple and matches CommonMark's common case: a
line whose first non-space characters are ``` or ~~~ toggles fenced state. It
does not model info strings, indented code blocks, or differing fence lengths,
because a SKILL.md that needs those has a bigger problem than this parser. Two
consequences worth stating rather than discovering: a `~~~` line inside a
```-fence toggles the state early, and a heading placed inside a *legitimate*
fence disappears from both guards silently whenever the classification has no row
for it. An UNCLOSED fence hides everything after it, which fails loudly at set
equality — the safe direction.

**Why `sections()` and `class_rows()` live here too.** The callers deliberately
keep their own PAIRS lists, because those are policy and may legitimately differ.
Parsing is not policy, and a divergence in it is silent: the guard that sees less
is the one that stops guarding. Both divergences below were found by an
adversarial review that mutation-probed them, not by the suite going red.

    Excluding the heading is the point, not an accident. A retention marker is a

    heading itself pins nothing, because `MISSING-HEADING` already guarantees the
    heading. One live row was exactly that shape (`| Subcommands | Subcommands |`).

    A body runs to the next heading of ANY depth, so a rule that lives in a
    subsection belongs to that subsection, not to its parent.

    Duplicate heading text collapses here; `check-extraction-classification.py`
    reports duplicates separately and set equality cannot survive them anyway.

    SHARED so the two guards cannot disagree about what a row is. They did:

    check-extraction-classification.py required only 4+ cells, making the
    retention guard's row set a strict SUBSET of the classification guard's. A
    one-character edit to a bytes cell (`497` -> `n/a`) dropped `## Hard rules`
    out of the retention sweep entirely, with BOTH guards green and the only
    trace a population count moving 71 -> 70 that nothing asserted.

    A row under a `### <class>` heading whose bytes cell is not a digit is
    returned with malformed=True rather than skipped, so it can be REPORTED. A
    silent skip is what let the divergence hide.

    **Deliberately fence-blind**, unlike `headings()` above, which is the one
    asymmetry in this module. A classification table inside a fenced block would
    be parsed as real rows. No shipped table has one, and a fenced 4-column table
    under a `### <class>` heading is not a shape these documents use — but the
    asymmetry is stated here rather than left for a reader to trip on, because the
    rest of this module is about fences.
