"""Guard: a plugin's prose description must not drift from its own `skills[]`.

Each plugin manifest carries a long prose description that walks the plugin's
skills, and the root marketplace entry mirrors it verbatim. Both drifted twice
without anyone noticing (BL-011): `capability-router` shipped in `skills[]` but
was never named in the prose, and the "Fourteen-skill" count kept being bumped
while the enumeration behind it did not. A count and a list that disagree are
worse than either alone — the count says the reader has seen everything.

Checks, per plugin:

  1. the marketplace entry's description is byte-identical to the manifest's —
     always, since the two are declared mirrors;
  2. a leading "<Number>-skill" claim equals `len(skills)`;
  3. every entry in `skills[]` is named somewhere in the description — but ONLY
     for a plugin that makes such a count claim. A thematic description that
     never promises exhaustiveness may legitimately name a subset; "N-skill" is
     the specific claim that tells the reader they have seen all N, and it is
     that pairing which rotted in BL-011. Today only `planning` claims a count.

Exit 0 when clean, 1 with a per-plugin report otherwise.
