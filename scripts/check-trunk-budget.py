"""A ratchet on skill trunk sizes: no SKILL.md may exceed its recorded ceiling.

A skill's *body* is loaded per invocation, not per session, so every byte in a
trunk is paid every time the skill fires, in every project with the plugin
enabled. Trunks therefore grow the way costs grow when nobody is measuring:
`planning/skills/executing-plans/SKILL.md` gained 34% — 69,527 -> 92,987 B — in
the six days between the token-efficiency plan being authored and executed, one
reasonable section at a time.

`scripts/trunk-budget.txt` records one `<repo-relative-path> <max-bytes>` line
per trunk. The ceiling is seeded at the size measured when the entry is written,
so the ratchet's day-one value does not depend on any extraction happening: a
trunk may shrink freely and may not grow at all. Ceilings are lowered by hand
when an extraction lands, which is what makes the reduction durable rather than
a number that drifts back up.

Three failure modes this deliberately treats as errors rather than skips:

  - A budgeted file that does not exist. Skipping it would let a deleted or
    renamed trunk read as compliant forever.
  - A trunk over `--min-size` with no budget entry. Without this the ratchet is
    opt-in, and a new fat trunk opts out of it by simply never being listed.
  - A STALE ceiling: a trunk that has shrunk more than `--max-slack` below its
    recorded ceiling (BL-066). The paragraph above says ceilings are lowered by
    hand when an extraction lands, "which is what makes the reduction durable
    rather than a number that drifts back up" -- but nothing checked that the
    hand-lowering happened, so the gap between a shrunk trunk and its unchanged
    ceiling was silent room to grow straight back. Measured 2026-08-31: 2 of 23
    ceilings had already drifted (+4 B and +103 B), where all 22 sat at +0 when
    the gap was filed three weeks earlier.

The floor and the stale ceiling are the same defect wearing two hats, which is
why one fix answers both: each is room to grow that the ratchet does not
measure. A trunk under `--min-size` carries implicit headroom up to the floor;
a stale ceiling carries it explicitly. So the summary states the total
unmeasured headroom rather than implying the ratchet covers everything -- a
count of budgeted trunks says nothing about what is NOT budgeted.

Read-only: never writes to the repo. Exit 0 when every trunk is within its
ceiling and no ceiling is stale, 1 otherwise.
