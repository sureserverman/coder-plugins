"""check-doc-coverage — every shipped component is named in its plugin's README.

Enforces the mechanical half of docs/plugin-readme-contract.md:

  * every plugin in .claude-plugin/marketplace.json has a README.md;
  * every component on disk has its name present in that README —
    skills/agents/commands via the shared PATTERNS in _frontmatter_common.py,
    plus hooks and .mcp.json (which carry no frontmatter, so the shared rules
    correctly omit them and this guard must not), excluding /tests/ and
    /fixtures/;
  * the README is not a stub relative to how many components it must cover.

**What this CANNOT check.** It cannot tell a real usage section from a component
name sitting in a bullet list. Coverage is a floor, not a quality bar: green
means nothing is missing, NOT that anything is well explained. Read it as
exactly that much, and do not let an allowlist entry substitute for writing the
section — that inverts the guard into a way of recording what you skipped.

Exceptions: scripts/doc-coverage-allow.txt, one `plugin/component` per line with
a written reason after `#`, mirroring frontmatter-budget-allow.txt.

Run: python3 scripts/check-doc-coverage.py [--summary] [--plugin NAME]
