## Reference resolution — check the path, not the variable

`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` being *set* is not the same as a reference being *there*: a
partially-installed or superseded plugin cache resolves to a directory that exists with the
file missing, and an unset-only test reads that as success. **Confirm each resolved
reference exists before relying on it.** If one does not — or the variable is unset — fall
back in this order, and say which one you used:

1. the **versioned plugin cache** — `Glob` `**/{PLUGIN}/*/<the reference path that follows ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/>`
2. a **dev checkout** — `Glob` `**/{PLUGIN}/<that same path>`

Keep that suffix exactly as the reference is written in this file rather than guessing a
shape.{DEPTH_NOTE}
A fallback that silently matches nothing is worse than none: it reports a healthy reference
as unreadable and sends the run into the banner below for no reason.

The order is not cosmetic — the cache is what the operator is actually running, so a
checkout preferred over it would ground the work in rules that are not in force.

**Open with `DEGRADED {NOUN} — <references that could not be read>` as the FIRST LINE of
your output whenever any named reference went unread.** Not a closing caveat: a degraded run
and a complete one are otherwise identical in shape, so the disclosure has to arrive before
the content, not after it (DEC-009).
